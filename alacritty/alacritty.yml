env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use `alacritty` if it is
  # available, otherwise `xterm-256color` is used.
  TERM: xterm-256color

window:
  # Window dimensions (changes require restart)

  # Specified in number of columns/lines, not pixels.
  # If both are `0`, this setting is ignored.
  #dimensions:
  #  columns: 0

  #
  # Specified in number of pixels.
  # If the position is not set, the window manager will handle the placement.
  #position:
  #  x: 0

  # Window padding (changes require restart)
  #
  # Blank space added around the window in pixels. This padding is scaled
  # by DPI and the specified value is always added at both opposing sides.
  padding:
    x: 10

  # Window decorations
  #
  # Values for `decorations`:
  #     - full: Borders and title bar
  #     - none: Neither borders nor title bar
  #
  # Values for `decorations` (macOS only):
  #     - transparent: Title bar, transparent background and title bar buttons
  #     - buttonless: Title bar, transparent background, but no title bar buttons
  decorations: buttonless

  # Startup Mode (changes require restart)
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode`:
  #   - Windowed
  #   - Maximized
  #   - Fullscreen
  #
  # Values for `startup_mode` (macOS only):
  #   - SimpleFullscreen
  startup_mode: Windowed

    # Application instance name

    general: Alacritty

  opacity: 0.9

  # GTK theme variant (Linux/BSD only)
  #
  # Override the variant of the GTK theme. Commonly supported values are `dark` and `light`.
  # Set this to `None` to use the default theme variant.
  #gtk_theme_variant: None

scrolling:
  # Maximum number of lines in the scrollback buffer.

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
#
# Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
# To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
# change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
